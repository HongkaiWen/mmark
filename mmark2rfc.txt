                  Using mmark to create I-Ds and RFCs
                       draft-gieben-mmark2rfc-00

Abstract

   This document describes an markdown variant called mmark [mmark] that
   can be used to create RFC documents.  The aim of mmark is to make
   writing document as natural as possible, while providing a lot of
   power on how to structure and layout the document.

   The source of this document [1] provides a good example.

1.  Introduction

   Mmark [mmark] is a markdown processor.  It supports the basic
   markdown syntax and has been extended with (syntax) features found in
   other Markdown implementations like kramdown [2], PHP markdown extra

   [3], pandoc [4], leanpub [5] and asciidoc [6].  This allows mmark to
   be used to write larger, structured documents such as RFC and I-Ds or
   even books.

   Mmark is a fork of blackfriday [blackfriday] written in Golang and it
   is very fast.  Input to mmark must be UTF-8, the output is also UTF-
   8.  Mmark converts tabs to 4 spaces.

   The goals of mmark are:

   (I)     Self contained: a single file can be converted to XML2RFC v2
           or (v3) or HTML5;

   (II)    Make the markdown "source code" look as natural as possible;

   (III)   Provide seemless upgrade path to XML2RFC v3.

   Mmark uses two scans when converting a document and does not build an
   internal AST of the document, this means it can not adhere 100% to
   the CommonMark [7] specification, however the CommonMark test suite
   is used when developing mmark.  Currently mmark passes 60% of the
   tests.

   Using Figure 1 from [RFC7328], mmark can be positioned as follows:

    +-------------------+   pandoc   +---------+
    | ALMOST PLAIN TEXT |   ------>  | DOCBOOK |
    +-------------------+            +---------+
                  |      \                 |
    non-existent  |       \_________       | xsltproc
      faster way  |        *mmark*  \      |
                  v                  v     v
          +------------+    xml2rfc  +---------+
          | PLAIN TEXT |  <--------  |   XML   |
          +------------+             +---------+

                                 Figure 1

   Note that kramdown-2629 [8] fills the same niche as mmark.

2.  Mmark Syntax

3.  TOML header

   Mmark uses TOML [toml] document header to specify the document's meta
   data.  Each line of this header must start with an "%".

Internet-Draft                  mmark2rfc                  December 2014


4.  Citations

   A citation can be entered using the syntax from @pandoc:
   "[@reference]", such a reference is "informative" by default.  Making
   a reference informative or normative can be done with a "?" and "!"
   respectively: "[@!reference]" is a normative reference.

   For RFC and I-Ds the references are generated automatically, although
   for I-Ds you might need to include a draft version in the reference
   "[@?I-D.draft-blah,#06]", creates an informative reference to the
   seventh version of draft-blah.

   If the need arises (usually when citing a document that is not in the
   XML2RFC database) an XML reference fragment can be included, note
   that this needs to happen _before_ the back matter is started,
   because that is the point when the references are outputted (right
   now the implementation does not scan the entire file for citations,
   also see [9].

5.  Internal References

   The cross reference syntax is "[](#id)", which allows for an optional
   title between the brackets.  Usually this is left empty, for this use
   case mmark allows the shortcut form "(#id)" which omits the brackets
   in its entirely.

6.  Document divisions

   Using "{mainmatter}" on a line by itself starts the main matter
   (middle) of the document, "{backmatter}" starts the appendix.  There
   is also a "{frontmatter}" that starts the front matter (front) of the
   document, but is normally not needed because the TOML header
   (Section 3) starts that by default.

7.  Abstract

   Any paragraph prefixed with "A>" is an abstract.  This is similar to
   asides and notes (Section 14.1 , Section 14.2) work.  Note that an
   RFC document can only have one abstract.

8.  Captions

   Whenever an blockquote, fenced codeblock or image has caption text,
   the entire block is wrapped in a "<figure>" and the caption text is
   put in a "<name>" tag for v3.

   Captions for tables are supported in pandoc, but not for code block.
   In mmark you can put a caption under either (even after a fenced code

   block).  Referencing these element (and thus creating an document
   "id" for them), is done with an IAL (Section 11:

   {#identifier}
   Name    | Age
   --------|-----:
   Bob     | 27
   Alice   | 23

   An empty line between the IAL and the table of indented code block is
   allowed.

8.1.  Figures

   Any text directly after the figure starting with "Figure:" is used as
   the caption.

8.2.  Quotes

   After a quote (a paragraph prefixed with ">") you can add a caption:

   Quote: Name -- URI for attribution

   In v3 this is used in the block quote attributes, for v2 it is
   discarded.

8.3.  Tables

   A table caption is signalled by using "Table:" directly after the
   table.  The table syntax used that one of Markdown Extra [10].

9.  References

   internal referencs, external ones

10.  Tables

   Tables can be created by drawing them in the input using a simple
   syntax:

   Name    | Age
   --------|-----:
   Bob     | 27
   Alice   | 23

   Tables can also have a footer, use equal signs instead of dashes for
   the separator, to start a table footer.  If there are multiple footer

Internet-Draft                  mmark2rfc                  December 2014


   lines, the first one is used as a starting point for the table
   footer.

   Name    | Age
   --------|-----:
   Bob     | 27
   Alice   | 23
   ======= | ====
   Charlie | 4

   If a table is started with a _block table header_, which starts with
   a pipe or plus sign and a minimum of three dashes, it is a *Block
   Table*. A block table may include block level elements in each (body)
   cell.  If we want to start a new cell use the block table header
   syntax.  In the example below we include a list in one of the cells.

   |-----------------+------------+-----------------|
   | Default aligned |Left aligned| Center aligned  |
   |-----------------|:-----------|:---------------:|
   | Bob             |Second cell | Third cell      |
   | Alice           |foo         | **strong**      |
   | Charlie         |quux        | baz             |
   |-----------------+------------+-----------------|
   | Bob             | foot       | 1. Item2        |
   | Alice           | quuz       | 2. Item2        |
   |=================+============+=================|
   | Footer row      | more footer| and more        |
   |-----------------+------------+-----------------|

   Note that the header and footer can't contain block level elements.

11.  Inline Attribute Lists

   This borrows from [kramdown][[11]], with the difference that the
   colon is dropped and each IAL must be typeset _before_ the block
   element (see Appendix A).  Added an anchor to blockquote can be done
   like so:

   {#quote:ref1}
   > A block quote

   You can specify classes with ".class" (although these are not used
   when converting to XML2RFC), and arbitrary key value pairs where each
   key/value becomes an attribute.

12.  Lists

12.1.  Ordered Lists

   The are several ways to start an ordered lists.

12.2.  Unordered Lists

12.3.  Definition Lists

   Mmark supports the definition list syntax from PHP Markdown Extra
   [12], meaning there can not be a empty line between the term and the
   definition.  Note the multiple terms and definition syntax is _not_
   supported.

12.4.  Example Lists

   This is the example list syntax from pandoc [13].  References to
   example lists work as well.  Note that an example list always needs
   to have an identifier, "(@good)" works, "(@)" does not.

13.  Miscellaneous

13.1.  HTML Comment

   If a HTML comment contains "--", it will be rendered as a "cref"
   comment in the resulting XML file.  Typically "<!-- Miek Gieben --
   you want to include the next paragraph? -->".

13.2.  Including Files

   Files can be included using "{{filename}}", "filename" is relative to
   the current working directory if it is not absolute.

13.3.  Ordered lists

   Mmark pays attention to the starting number of a list:

   4. Item 4
   5. Item 5

   Will start of ordered list with element 4.

14.  XML2RFC V3 features

   The v3 syntax adds some new features, those can already be used in
   mmark (even for documents targeting v2 -- but there they will be
   faked with the limited constructs of v2 syntax).

Internet-Draft                  mmark2rfc                  December 2014


14.1.  Asides

   Any paragraph prefixed with "AS>".  For v2 this becomes a indented
   paragraph.

14.2.  Notes

   Any paragraph prefixed with "N>".  For v2 this becomes a indented
   paragraph.

14.3.  RFC 2119 Keywords

   Any [RFC2119] keyword used with strong emphasis _and_ in uppercase
   will be typeset within "bcp14" tags, that is "**MUST**" becomes
   "<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>", but "**must**" will not.  For v2 they are
   stripped of the emphasis and outputted as-is.

14.4.  Super- and Subscripts

   Use H~2~O and 2^10^ is 1024.  In v2 these are outputted as-is.

14.5.  Images

15.  Converting from RFC 7328 Syntax

   Converting from an RFC 7328 ([RFC7328]) document can be done using
   the quick and dirty Perl script [14], which uses pandoc to output
   markdown PHP extra and converts that into proper mmark: (mmark is
   more like markdown PHP extra, than like pandoc).

   for i in middle.mkd back.mkd; do \
       pandoc --atx-headers -t markdown_phpextra < $i |
       ./parts.pl
   done

   Note this:

   o  Does not convert the abstract to a prefixed paragraph;

   o  Makes all RFC references normative;

   o  Handles all figure and table captions and adds references (if
      appropriate);

   o  Probably has other bugs, so a manual review should be in order.

Internet-Draft                  mmark2rfc                  December 2014


   There is also titleblock.pl [15] which can be given an [RFC7328]
   "template.xml" file and will output a TOML titleblock, that can be
   used as a starting point.

      Yes, this uses pandoc and Perl.. why?  Becasue if mmark could
      parse the file by itself, there wasn't much of problem.  Two
      things are holding this back: mmark cannot parse definition lists
      with empty spaces and there isn't renderer that can output
      markdown syntax.

   For now the mmark parser will not get any features that makes it
   backwards compatible with pandoc2rfc.
