                       draft-gieben-mmark2rfc-00

Abstract

   This document describes an markdown variant called mmark [mmark] that
   can be used to create RFC documents.  The aim of mmark is to make
   writing document as natural as possible, while providing a lot of
   power on how to structure and layout the document.

   Of course the source of this document [1] provides an excellent
   example.

1.  Introduction

   Mmark [mmark] is a markdown processor.  It supports the basic
   markdown syntax and has been extended to support more (syntax)
   features needed to write larger, structured documents such as RFC and
   I-Ds.  The extra syntax elements have been copied from kramdown,
   leanpub, markdown extra and Asciidoc.

   The goals of mmark can be stated as:

   (I)    Self contained: a single file can be converted to XML2RFC v2
          or (v3);

   (II)   Make the markdown source code look as natural as possible.

   Mmark is a fork of blackfriday [blackfriday] written in Golang.

   Using Figure 1 from [RFC7328], mmark can be positioned as follows:

    +-------------------+   pandoc   +---------+
    | ALMOST PLAIN TEXT |   ------>  | DOCBOOK |
    +-------------------+            +---------+
                  |      \                 |
    non-existent  |       \_________       | xsltproc
      faster way  |         mmark   \      |
                  v                  v     v
          +------------+    xml2rfc  +---------+
          | PLAIN TEXT |  <--------  |   XML   |
          +------------+             +---------+

                                 Figure 1

   Note that kramdown-2629 [2] fills the same niche as mmark.

2.  TOML header

   Mmark uses TOML [toml] document header to specify the document's meta
   data.  Each line of this header must start with an "%".

3.  Citations

   A citation can be entered by using the syntax from pandoc [pandoc]:
   "[@reference]", such a reference is "informative" by default.  Making
   a reference informative or normative can be done with a "?" and "!"
   respectively: "[@!reference]" is a normative reference.

Internet-Draft                  mmark2rfc                  December 2014


   For RFC and I-Ds the references are generated automatically, although
   for I-Ds you might need to include a draft version in the reference
   "[@?I-D.draft-blah,#06]", creates an informative reference to the
   sixth version of draft-blah.

   If the need arises an XML reference fragment can be included, not
   that this needs to happen before the back matter is started, because
   that is the point when the references are outputted.

4.  Document divisions

   Using "{mainmatter}" on a line by itself starts the main matter
   (middle) of the document, "{backmatter}" starts the appendix.  There
   is also a "{frontmatter}" that starts the front matter (front) of the
   document, but is normally not need because the TOML header
   (Section 2) starts that by default.

5.  Abstract

   Any paragraph prefix with "A>" is an abstract.  This is similar to
   asides and notes (Section 9.1 , Section 9.2) work.

6.  Captions

   Captions for tables are supported in pandoc, but not for code block.
   In mmark you can put a caption under either (even after a fenced code
   block).  Referencing these element (and thus creating an document
   "id" for them), is done with an IAL (Section 7:

   {#identifier}
   Name    | Age
   --------|-----:
   Bob     | 27
   Alice   | 23

   An empty line between the IAL and the table of indented code block is
   allowed.

6.1.  Figures

   Any text directly after the figure starting with "Figure:" is used as
   the caption.

6.2.  Table

   A table caption is signalled by using "Table:" directly after the
   table.  The table syntax used that one of Markdown Extra [3].

Internet-Draft                  mmark2rfc                  December 2014


6.3.  Quotes

   After a quote (a paragraph prefixed with ">") you can add a caption:

   Quote: Name -- URI for attribution

   In v3 this is used in the block quote attributes, for v2 it is
   discarded.

7.  Inline Attribute Lists

   This borrows from [kramdown][[4]], which the difference that the
   colon is dropped and each IAL must be typeset _before_ the block
   element.  Added an anchor to blockquote can be done like so:

   {#quote:ref1}
   > A block quote

   You can specify classes with ".class" (although these are not used
   when converting to XML2RFC), and arbitrary key value pairs where each
   key becomes an attribute.

8.  Miscellaneous

8.1.  Example Lists

   This is the example list syntax from pandoc [5].

   The reference syntax "(@list-id)" is _not_ supported.

8.2.  HTML Comment

   If a HTML comment contains "--", it will be rendered as a "cref"
   comment in the resulting XML file.  Typically "<!-- Miek Gieben --
   you want to include the next paragraph? -->".

8.3.  RFC 2119 Keywords

   Any [RFC2119] keyword used with strong emphasis _and_ in uppercase
   will be typeset within "bcp14" tags, that is "**MUST**" becomes
   "<bcp14>MUST</bcp14", but "**must**" will not.

8.4.  Including Files

   Files can be included using "{{filename}}", "filename" is relative to
   the current working directory it not absolute.

9.  XML2RFC V3 features

   The v3 syntax adds some new features, those can already be used in
   mmark (even for documents targetting v2 -- but there they will be
   faked with the limited constructs of v2 syntax).

9.1.  Asides

   Any paragraph prefixed with "AS>".

9.2.  Notes

   Any paragraph prefixed with "N>".

9.3.  Images

10.  Converting from RFC 7328 Syntax

      The author is pondering an automated conversion mechanism.

   The markdown syntax in [RFC7328] is slightly more liberal than the
   one from mmark.

10.1.  Citations

   Citations in [RFC7238] are done by using references: "[](#RFC5155)"
   in mmark you use a proper citation "[@RFC5155]" (with possibly some
   metadata).

10.2.  Definition Lists

   Pandoc allows an empty line between the term and the definition:

   Original owner name:

   :   the owner name corresponding to a hashed owner name if hashing is
       used. Or the owner name as-is if no hashing is used.

   Mmark does not, use:

   Original owner name:
   :   the owner name corresponding to a hashed owner name if hashing is
       used. Or the owner name as-is if no hashing is used.

10.3.  Figure Captions

   Instead of using the footnote syntax below a figure, in mmark you can
   just use 'Figure: '.

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Hash Alg.   |     Flags     |  Iterations   | Salt Length   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                             Salt                              /
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   ^[fig:dnsnxtparam-wire::The NEXTPARAM on-the-wire format.]

   And use an IAL to define an anchor:

   {#fig:dnsnxtparam-wire}

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |   Hash Alg.   |     Flags     |  Iterations   | Salt Length   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                             Salt                              /
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   Figure: The NEXTPARAM on-the-wire format.

10.4.  Table Caption

   Table captions work identically to figure captions, except that you
   use: "Table: Caption text."

10.5.  Indicess

   Use "(((term, subterm)))" instead of using footnotes.  Making "term"
   a primary term, is done with "(((!term, subterm)))".

10.6.  Ordered Lists with Custom Counters

   Use an IAL for that:

   {format="REQ(%c)"}
   1. Term1
   1. Term2
